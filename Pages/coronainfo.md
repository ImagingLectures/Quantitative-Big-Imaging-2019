# The QBI Lectures continue with new options

The corona virus has affected our daily lifes and how we interact with people. The general policy at ETH, as you probably already heard, is that the lecture activities will continue. 

If you think you are a person at risk, I kindly ask you to approach me to find a way for you to continue following the course remotely. 

In the case of my QBI lectures, I will continue as follows:
1. I will still teach in the same lecture room as before.
2. The lectures will be recorded and uploaded on the [QBI YouTube play list](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcDfeQH_rVdbu7VooFvWA6F9gctY-UUwN).
3. From next week (2020-03-19), I will also offer the webinar posibility using [Zoom](https://zoom.us/).
4. Exercises can still be done in the lecture room. If are not able to participate in the exercises, I first recommend to use the consultation hour alternatively send me an email and we can arrange an appointment on skype.  
5. The consultation hour is still offered, with the extended posibility to also ask for appointments on skype.

__Note:__ The above items may change when new directives are given from the ETH management.
